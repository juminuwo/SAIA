# StepperAI

I wanted to make an AI stepper made of only stepcharts artists I liked, I was sure it was going to be a great.

StepperAI predicts steps per measure, music features are generated by [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/wiki/3.-Feature-Extraction), and the step patterns are of course learned by the data (the stepcharts and songs) you give it.
