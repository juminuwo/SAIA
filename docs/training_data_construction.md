### Key things to remember:
- LSTM type (sequence prediction)
- Variable input
- Different note types (8th, 12th, 16th, etc.) need to have AI learn measure breaks well
- Difficulty levels

### Candidate Structures
- Predict measure at a time.
- Predict for each 32nd (or any other note type) and have that as a limit.
